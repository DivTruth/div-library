Div Library (part of the Div Blend) - Alpha
===================

Div Library is a plugin that was developed to help maintain the WordPress integrity throughout the development process without sacrificing the freedom of creative solution for developers. Unlike "user-based frameworks" (i.e. Genesis) that are bulky and difficult to modify without being an expert, the Div Library is a **developer solution** with a minimalist approach to follow **#TheWordPRessWay**. Even as a young developer you will feel empowered with the best practices of the most common needs for WordPress development.

Be sure to read more about this on the [Div Library Page](http://divblend.com/div-library). Also, please read [our philosophy](http://divblend.com/div-blend-philosophy/) and consider _why_ we have abstracted these components the way we have so that you can better understand the intention and scope of the Div Blend project as a whole.
